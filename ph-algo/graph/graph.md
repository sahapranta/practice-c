## Basics
- Multiple Edge
- Multiple Way
- Cycle
- Edge Direction (undirected)

### Types of Graph
- Undirected Graph
- Directed Graph
- Weighted Graph
- Unweighted Graph
- Cycle in Graph
    - Undirected Graph requires minimum of three nodes to make cycle. One edge of two nodes cannot make cycle.
    - Directed graphs can make cycle with two nodes.


## Structure
 - adjacency Matrix
 - adjacency list
 - edge list
